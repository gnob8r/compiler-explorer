Compiler Explorer
------------

Compiler Explorer is an interactive compiler. The left-hand pane shows editable C/C++/Rust/Go/D code. The right, the
assembly output of having compiled the code with a given compiler and settings. Multiple compilers are supported, and
the UI layout is configurable (the [Golden Layout](https://www.golden-layout.com/) library is used for this).

Try out one of the demo sites: [C++][cpp], [Rust][rust], [D][d] or [Go][go].

### Developing

Compiler Explorer is written in node.js.

Assuming you have npm and node installed, simply running `make` ought to get you up and running with an Explorer
running on port 10240 on your local machine: http://localhost:10240/

The `Makefile` will automatically install all the third party libraries needed to run; using `npm` to install server-side
components and `bower` to install all the client-facing libraries.

If you want to point it at your own GCC or similar binaries,either edit the
`etc/config/gcc-explorer.defaults.properties` or else make a new one with the name
`gcc-explorer.YOURHOSTNAME.properties`.  The config system leaves a lot to be desired,
I'm working on porting [CCS](https://github.com/hellige/ccs-cpp) to javascript and then something more rational can be used.

Feel free to raise an issue on [github](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer/issues) or
[email me directly](mailto:matt@godbolt.org) for more help.

Compiler Explorer is maintained by [Matt Godbolt](http://xania.org). Multiple compiler and difference view was
implemented by [Gabriel Devillers](https://github.com/voxelf).
