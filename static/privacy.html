<h1>What data do we store?</h1>
<p>None. We're not on the business of collecting user data.</p>
<h2>What do you collect?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Anonymized usage analytics</li>
    <li>Anonymized server logs, which we keep around for X (TODO: Update) days, and then get deleted</li>
</ul>
<h2>What don't you store?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We don't store your code anywhere. Google URL Shortener only stores relations between short keys and their corresponding long url.
    All the data needed is encoded on the URLs. We plan to evetually stop relying on Google for the URL shortening service, which will force us
    to securely store the code you choose to create short urls for.</li>
    <li>We don't store personal information, nor anything that could identify you between sessions / services</li>
</ul>
