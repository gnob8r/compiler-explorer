<h1><span style="color: darkslategray">Necessary</span> Local Storage</h1>
<p>To store your preferred options between sessions, such as your input code &amp; pane layout,
    we make use of your browser's localStorage, where we place:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The current page state (Such as: your current code, selected compilers, pane layout, font sizes)</li>
    <li>Your settings as shown in the settings popup (Which can be found at: More > Settings)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the usage of localStorage is necessary for the proper functioning of the site, so they won't be disabled
 if you choose to not grant cookie usage consent. More info on the FAQ.</p>
